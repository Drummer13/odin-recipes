This is my first project where i practice my HTML knowledge. It's a recipes website where i have to make four HTML pages (homepage and 3 recipes) and link them together. The homepage must contain a link of every recipe page in an unordered list form. The recipes pages must have the structure of:

-h1 tittle
-an image
-a description of recipe
-Ingredients tittle 
-Ingredients unordered list
-Steps tittle
-Steps ordered list
